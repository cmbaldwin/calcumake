        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "CalcuMake's advanced calculator supports multi-plate calculations with up to 10 plates and 16 filaments per plate, providing the most detailed cost breakdown including filament, electricity, labor, and machine depreciation. Unlike basic calculators, it handles complex multi-material prints and batch production scenarios."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Calculate 3D printing costs by adding: (1) Filament cost = weight (grams) × price per kg ÷ 1000, (2) Electricity = print time (hours) × printer wattage × electricity rate per kWh, (3) Labor = time × hourly rate, (4) Machine depreciation = printer cost ÷ expected lifetime prints. CalcuMake automates all these calculations."

      "name": "How much does 3D printing cost per hour?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "3D printing costs $0.50-$2.00 per hour for hobbyist FDM printers, including filament (~$0.30/hr), electricity (~$0.05/hr), and machine wear (~$0.15-1.65/hr depending on printer cost). Professional printers can cost $5-50/hr. Use CalcuMake to calculate exact costs for your specific setup."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can I calculate costs for multiple 3D prints at once?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, CalcuMake supports multi-plate calculations, allowing you to calculate costs for up to 10 build plates simultaneously with different filaments and settings for each plate. This is perfect for batch production or comparing different print configurations."
