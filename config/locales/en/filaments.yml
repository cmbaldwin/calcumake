        description: Our AI analyzes the content you provide and automatically extracts filament information.
        point_1: The AI identifies filament names, brands, materials, and specifications
        point_2: Multiple filaments from a single source (like bulk orders) are detected automatically
        point_3: Duplicate names are handled automatically with numbered suffixes
        point_4: Extracted data is validated before being added to your library
