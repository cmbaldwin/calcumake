      title: Frequently Asked Questions
      trial_question: How does the trial work?
      trial_answer: New users get a 14-day free trial of the Startup plan. No credit card required. At the end of the trial, you can choose to upgrade or continue with the free plan.
      change_plan_question: Can I change plans at any time?
      change_plan_answer: Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. Upgrades are prorated and applied immediately. Downgrades take effect at the end of your current billing period.
      cancel_question: What happens if I cancel?
      cancel_answer: You will continue to have access to your plan features until the end of your current billing period. After that, you will be downgraded to the free plan.

      payment_answer: We accept all major credit cards via Stripe. All payments are secure and encrypted.
      data_question: What happens to my data if I downgrade?
