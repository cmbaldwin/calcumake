    faq:
      headline: Frequently Asked Questions
      accuracy:
        question: How accurate are the calculations?
        answer: CalcuMake uses simple formulas and accounts for all cost factors including
          filament, electricity, labor time, and machine depreciation.
      currencies:
        question: What currencies does CalcuMake support?
        answer: CalcuMake currently supports USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, and AUD with
          automatic formatting and precision for each currency. You can switch currencies
          anytime in your profile settings.
      printers:
        question: Does CalcuMake support my 3D printer?
        answer: CalcuMake works with any 3D printer! You simply enter your printer's
          power consumption and other specifications. We're planning support for resin
          printers soon!
      electricity:
        question: How do electricity costs work?
        answer: CalcuMake automatically calculates electricity costs based on your
          printer's power consumption (in watts), print duration, and your local energy
          rate per kWh. This ensures you never forget this often-overlooked cost factor.
      invoices:
        question: Can I customize my invoices?
        answer: Yes! You can add your company logo, customize colors, and include
          your business information. Paid plans remove the CalcuMake branding for
          a completely professional look.
