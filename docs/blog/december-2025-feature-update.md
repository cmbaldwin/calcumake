## What's New in December 2025

This is our biggest update yet! We're excited to announce full resin printing support, a searchable printer profiles database, and smart technology synchronization. These updates make CalcuMake the complete solution for both FDM and resin 3D printing businesses.

## Full Resin Printing Support

CalcuMake now supports resin (SLA/DLP/MSLA) printing with the same powerful cost calculation features you know from FDM.

### Register Your Resins

Just like filaments, you can now register all your resins in CalcuMake:

- **Resin type**: Standard, ABS-like, water-washable, tough, flexible, and more
- **Volume and cost**: Track your resin inventory by volume (ml) and cost
- **Color options**: Organize resins by color for easy selection
- **Manufacturer details**: Keep track of brands and specific products

### Calculate Resin Print Costs

When creating a print calculation for a resin printer:

- Enter resin volume used (in ml) instead of filament weight
- Set markup percentages for resin materials
- Account for resin-specific post-processing time (washing, curing)
- Track costs across multiple plates just like FDM

### Unified Materials View

We've added a new **Materials** section that shows both filaments and resins in one place:

- Quick overview of all your registered materials
- Easy navigation between filament and resin management
- See your complete material inventory at a glance

## Searchable Printer Profiles Database

Setting up a new printer just got a lot faster. Instead of manually entering specifications, you can now search our database of 26+ popular 3D printers.

### How It Works

1. When adding a new printer, look for the "Start from a known printer" search box
2. Type any part of the manufacturer or model name (e.g., "bambu" or "elegoo")
3. Select your printer from the dropdown
4. Watch as the form auto-fills with accurate specifications

### Pre-Loaded Printers Include

**FDM Printers:**
- **Bambu Lab**: A1, A1 Mini, P1P, P1S, P1S Combo, X1 Carbon, X1E
- **Prusa**: MK4, MK4S, MINI+, XL (Single/Multi), CORE One
- **Creality**: Ender 3 V3, K1, K1 Max, K1C
- **Elegoo**: Neptune 4, Neptune 4 Pro
- **Anycubic**: Kobra 3

**Resin Printers:**
- **Elegoo**: Mars 4 Ultra, Saturn 3
- **Anycubic**: Photon Mono M5s
- And more being added regularly!

### Auto-Filled Specifications

Each profile includes:

- Printer name and manufacturer
- Material technology (FDM or Resin)
- Average power consumption in watts
- Approximate retail price in your currency

You can always edit any field after selection—the profiles are just a starting point to save you time.

## Smart Technology Synchronization

This feature ensures your print pricing calculations are always consistent with your printer's capabilities.

### The Problem We Solved

Previously, you could accidentally create a print job with resin settings on an FDM printer (or vice versa). This led to incorrect cost calculations and confusion.

### How It Works Now

When you select a printer in the print pricing form:

1. All plates automatically switch to that printer's technology (FDM or Resin)
2. The technology toggle becomes locked—you can see it but can't change it
3. Any new plates you add will also use the correct technology
4. If you change printers, all plates update automatically

### Visual Indicators

The technology buttons (FDM/Resin) appear slightly dimmed when locked, with a 70% opacity. This visual cue tells you that the setting is controlled by your printer selection.

### Flexibility When Needed

If you clear the printer selection (select the blank prompt option), the technology toggles become editable again. This is useful if you're doing calculations before deciding which printer to use.

## Security Updates

We've updated all gems to their latest versions, addressing security advisories and ensuring CalcuMake remains safe and secure:

- Updated authentication and session handling libraries
- Patched known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Improved overall application security posture

We take security seriously and regularly audit our dependencies to keep your data protected.

## Technical Improvements

Behind the scenes, we've also made improvements to form handling:

- **Smarter form submission**: Hidden fields for the "wrong" technology are now filtered out, preventing validation errors
- **Better resin support**: Fixed issues where resin print jobs could fail to save
- **Cleaner UI**: Improved styling for the printer profile search clear button
- **Unified navigation**: Materials section provides easy access to both filaments and resins

## Coming Soon: AI-Powered Profile Updates

We're building a weekly job that uses AI to discover and add new printer models as they're released. This means our database will stay current with the latest printers from all major manufacturers—both FDM and resin.

## Try It Now

These features are available to all CalcuMake users immediately:

- **[Register a Resin](/resins/new)** to start tracking your resin inventory
- **[Add New Printer](/printers/new)** to try the searchable profiles
- **[Create a New Print Calculation](/print_pricings/new)** to experience resin costing and technology sync
